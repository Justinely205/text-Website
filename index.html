<! –– This is the text that I will be working with, I didnt add it to the website yet because I didnt want it to overwhelm me. I probably will not use the whole poem, because it's a little too long.

i.@
he tells me not to hold back, @
that he doesn't mind the turbulence, @
that the ebb and flow of the current is peaceful, @
he says he finds solace in the honesty. @

i'm too scared to let down the floodgates, @
i'm afraid he'll drown in that honesty, @ because it is not always beautiful, @
he's been promising me for months that he's a good swimmer, @
but i don't even trust myself to just float. @

ii.@
my anchor has left me. @
and i began to wonder if she was really an anchor at all. @
she was more of a buoy floating just out of reach, @ moving with the wind,@
a mirage tricking me into believing her when she said loved me,@ that she'd always be there for me, @
she must have been drawn to me because my dark water contrasted her enough to make her stand out, @
and she was there for me if i lost my way,@
but only if i had the energy to seek out her bright colours@

iii. @ my mom is gaia herself. @the world takes advantage of her, @and she gives and gives not realizing there's going to be nothing left. @she is losing all her resources, @and when she sends that hurricane, it is a call for help, @and she knows it falls on deaf ears. @i feel clumsy with my stuttering waters, @ trying to reach out, but i cannot tie her here, @and she is the reason i am who i am. @


iv. @
i am starting to feel like im drowning in my own feelings. @
and sometimes i almost let the waves pull me under, @ if it will make the world quiet for one
fucking minute.@ 


Thank You, Friend

Thank you, friend, for all the things
That mean so much to me--
For concern and understanding
You give abundantly.

Thanks for listening with your heart;
For cheering me when I'm blue;
For bringing out the best in me;
And just for being you.

Thanks for in-depth conversation
That stimulates my brain;
For silly times we laugh out loud;
For things I can't explain.

For looking past my flaws and faults;
For all the time you spend;
For all the kind things that you do,
Thank you; thank you, friend.
